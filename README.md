**Coding agents are amnesiacs** — every session starts cold, re-deriving what you
already taught them and re-running experiments a past session already concluded.
PriorStates gives **Claude, Codex &amp; Gemini** one **local** memory and a searchable
**research journal**, so what one session learns, the next one remembers.

Runs entirely on your machine · CPU-only · no API keys · no cloud calls.

## Install — in one sentence

Already using Claude, Codex, or Gemini? Hand it one line:

> **Install PriorStates: fetch https://priorstates.com/install.md and follow it.**

The agent reads [`AGENT_INSTALL.md`](AGENT_INSTALL.md), installs the package, wires
itself over MCP, and verifies with `priorstates doctor` — then restart it to load
the new tools.

**Prefer to do it yourself?** Pick your platform:

<details open>
<summary><b>🐧 Linux (Debian / Ubuntu) — the <code>.deb</code> (recommended)</b></summary>

Apt pulls in `python3` + `numpy`, and you get the desktop app, an icon, the
`priorstates` CLI and man pages — nothing else to install:

```bash
curl -fSLO https://github.com/zqin2012/priorstates/releases/latest/download/priorstates_0.1.0_all.deb
sudo apt install -y ./priorstates_0.1.0_all.deb   # resolves python3 (>= 3.10) + python3-numpy
```

Then just **open “PriorStates” from your application menu** (or run
`priorstates-gui`). The desktop control panel does the rest — initialize your
memory, wire Claude / Codex / Gemini over MCP, and launch the cockpit, all with a
click. No further commands needed. (For agent integration it needs the MCP support
package once — `PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1 pip3 install --user mcp`; the app flags it if it's missing.)

`sudo apt remove priorstates` uninstalls. Re-running the same `apt install`
upgrades in place.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🪟 Windows — the one-click installer (easiest of all)</b></summary>

Download and run
**[PriorStates-Windows-Setup.exe](https://github.com/zqin2012/priorstates/releases/latest/download/PriorStates-Windows-Setup.exe)**
— it auto-installs Python if you don't have it, then installs PriorStates and adds
Start Menu + Desktop shortcuts. Nothing else required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🍎 macOS / any OS with Python 3.10+ — pip</b></summary>

```bash
PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1 pip install --user --no-cache-dir "priorstates @ git+https://github.com/zqin2012/priorstates.git"
priorstates init            # create ~/.priorstates + per-project .priorstates/
priorstates agents install  # wire Claude / Codex / Gemini over MCP
priorstates cockpit         # open the web cockpit → http://127.0.0.1:7700
```

macOS also has a native `.pkg` / Homebrew formula — see
[docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).
</details>

Full install matrix (`.deb` / macOS `.pkg` / Windows / source) is in
**[docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)**. No model download is required — a
built-in CPU hashing embedder works out of the box.

## What's inside

| | Subsystem | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 | **memory** | A local semantic store. Save a fact once — any future session recalls it *by meaning*. Pinned facts are injected into every session. |
| 📓 | **journal** | An append-only research log. Every winner, loser, bug &amp; decision becomes a searchable entry, so no experiment is run twice. |
| 🛰️ | **cockpit** | A **pure-Python** (stdlib-only) local web app that maps your memory, journal &amp; docs — search, group, dashboards. Embedded **terminal** (on by default for a local cockpit; `--no-terminal` to disable) to run your agent CLIs right in the browser. No Node.js, no npm, no build step. |
| 📝 | **mdlab** | Runnable Markdown: interleave prose, code &amp; results in one file and splice output back in. |

All of it is wired into your agents over the open **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)**
protocol by `priorstates agents install` — so they *recall* before acting and
*record* durable conclusions back, automatically.

## MCP server

`priorstates agents install` registers the server into Claude / Codex / Gemini for
you; to run it directly over stdio: **`priorstates mcp`**. It exposes 10 tools:

- **memory** — `memory_add` · `memory_search` · `memory_get` · `memory_list_pinned` · `memory_pin` · `memory_delete`
- **journal** — `journal_add` · `journal_search` · `journal_regen`
- **mdlab** — `mdlab_run`

## See it in action

The **cockpit** maps your whole research surface; the **CLI** captures and recalls from your terminal.

## Agent-neutral

One memory store and one journal, surfaced to **Claude Code · Claude Desktop · Codex ·
Gemini · Antigravity** through MCP and a pinned context block — no lock-in, no
rewrites. Switch agents without losing a thing. The **VS Code / JetBrains
extensions** for Claude Code and Codex share their CLI's MCP config, so they're
covered automatically; **Claude Desktop** (its own app) is wired into
`claude_desktop_config.json` too. Every client on the machine reads the *same*
local store, so a memory saved in one is instantly recalled in all the others.

## Private by default

Everything lives under `~/.priorstates/` and per-project `.priorstates/`. The
default embedder is **CPU-only and offline** — no API keys, no telemetry, no cloud
calls. Upgrade to semantic recall with a single optional ~127&nbsp;MB model download
whenever you want.

## Share a pack

Export your memory + journal as a portable bundle and hand it to a teammate (or
host it anywhere — any file or URL works):

```bash
priorstates pack export --name my-project        # → my-project.pspack
priorstates pack import ./my-project.pspack # on the other machine (or a URL)
```

Imported memory surfaces through the same MCP tools — no extra wiring. Imports are
**checksum-verified, shown for confirmation before ingest, and tagged with their
source** (and never auto-pinned). The **cockpit** has **Export** / **Import**
buttons too (Import needs the cockpit started with `--allow-write`).

**New here?** Load a ready-made sample to see PriorStates populated instantly:

```bash
priorstates pack import --demo
```

## Status

**v0.1 — working end-to-end:** memory, journal, mdlab, MCP server (10 tools),
agent wiring (Claude / Codex / Gemini / Antigravity), the web cockpit, and the
desktop launcher are all built and tested. Optional semantic model downloads on
demand; the hashing fallback needs zero setup. A background embedder daemon and
an autonomous `priorstates research` runner are next.
